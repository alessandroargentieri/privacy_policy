Privacy Policy of the app Crossover Auction

This app allows the user to register ONLY into a local SQLlite database.
No data are spread over the network.
It's just a local registration. 
You can insert a fake e-mail, so there is no confirmation-request.

It's requested the use of the camera just to shoot pics of the products you simulate you want to buy.

It's not a real auction!

Greetings.
